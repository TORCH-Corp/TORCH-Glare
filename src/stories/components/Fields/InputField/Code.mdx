This is the Glare `InputField` component, a versatile input solution that supports various configurations such as labels, icons, dropdowns, and action elements like buttons and badges. It is designed for flexibility with options for size, style, negative theming, and error handling.

The `InputField` component is implemented as a forward-ref component to allow passing refs to the input element. It conditionally renders either a `LabeledInput` or an `Input` component based on whether the `label` prop is provided.
