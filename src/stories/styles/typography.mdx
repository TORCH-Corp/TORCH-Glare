# Glare Framework Typography System

The Glare Framework Typography System employs a systematic approach using SCSS mixins to facilitate diverse typographic styles based on specific design requirements. This system is segmented into four main levels of typography, each with nested levels of specificity and styling options.

## Typography Levels

The system is structured into four primary levels:

- **Body Level**
- **Display Level**
- **Headers Level**
- **Labels Level**

Each of these levels is further divided into three nested levels:

- **Large Level**
- **Medium Level**
- **Small Level**

### Mixins for Each Level

For each nested level, four types of text styling mixins are provided, each catering to a different weight or style of font:

- **Bold Level Mixin**
- **SemiBold Level Mixin**
- **Medium Level Mixin**
- **Regular Level Mixin**

These mixins allow for consistent implementation of typography across various components and layouts within the framework.

## Directory Structure

The typography mixins are organized within the `src/lib/styles/typography` directory. Below is an outline of the structure and contents of each file:

### Entry Point

- **`index.scss`**:
  - **Description**: The main entry point for typography styles. This file should be imported into your project to gain access to all typography mixins.
  - **Location**: `src/lib/styles/typography/index.scss`

### Mixins

The mixins are categorized by language and type, allowing for localization and specific typographic treatments based on content type.

- **`mixins/EN/`**:
  - **Language-Specific Mixins**: Contains mixins for English typography settings.

#### Typography Categories

Each category contains three files corresponding to the nested levels (large, medium, small):

- **Body**
  - `_large.scss`, `_medium.scss`, `_small.scss`
- **Display**
  - `_large.scss`, `_medium.scss`, `_small.scss`
- **Headers**
  - `_large.scss`, `_medium.scss`, `_small.scss`
- **Labels**
  - `_large.scss`, `_medium.scss`, `_small.scss`

Each SCSS file within these categories contains the specific mixins for implementing the various text styles and weights as described.

## Usage

To use the typography mixins in your project, import the `index.scss` file at the top of your main stylesheet:

```scss
@import 'path/to/src/lib/styles/typography/index.scss';
```

This import will make all typography mixins available throughout your stylesheets, allowing you to apply consistent and scalable typography styles easily.

## Conclusion

The Glare Framework Typography System provides a robust and flexible set of tools for managing typography across your digital products. By leveraging SCSS mixins and organized file structures, it ensures that typography can be consistently applied and easily maintained across different parts of your application.
