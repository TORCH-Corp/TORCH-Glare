# TORCH Glare Components Library Developer HandBook

## Key Highlights

- **Framework Figma Design**: All components adhere to specifications found in the [Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/design/Q3aIuqsK0HWrUrOElSFEIb/TORCH-Glare-V1.5.2?node-id=1094-125590&t=ySiHG1iTEWxwMxhA-0). 
- **Consistency with Figma**: Component names and properties in the library match those in the Figma design file.
- **Documentation for Components**: Each component includes a simple README file detailing its usage and options.
- **Advanced Typography System**: Utilizes SCSS mixins based on the framework's design system for sophisticated typography management.
- **Color Mapping System**: Employs CSS variables within SCSS files to support multiple color modes including dark, light, and default.
- **Icon Library**: Incorporates font icons from the RemixIcons library.
- **Storybook Integration**: Comprehensive stories for all components are managed using the Storybook library.
- **Theming Provider**: you can change the components theme with ease by wrapping your app with ThemeWrapper context and use useTheme hook to take control of theme.
